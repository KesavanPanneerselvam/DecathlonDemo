Dear Team,

The time has come to say goodbye, which is never easy, especially after spending 8 wonderful months as part of the JP Morgan Chase family. It has been an incredible journey, filled with learning, growth, and memorable experiences. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from each of you.

A special thanks to the entire team for your guidance and support throughout my time here. To my friends and colleagues, thank you for the wonderful moments we’ve shared – memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.

Though I will miss you all, I am excited to take on a new challenge and begin the next phase of my career. I wish you all success and happiness in everything you do.

Please feel free to stay in touch. I can be reached at my personal email (kesavanpanneerselvam@gmail.com), phone (+447898857459), or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kesavan-panneerselvam/).

It has been a pleasure knowing and working with each of you. If I’ve inadvertently hurt anyone along the way, please accept my sincere apologies. Let’s keep in touch!

Warm regards,
Kesavan
